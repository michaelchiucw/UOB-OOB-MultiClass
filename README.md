# UOB-OOB-MultiClass

The multi-class version of Oversampling and Undersampling Online Bagging for class imbalanced data stream learning. It can be applied both to multi-class and binary classification problems.

Implementation as in the following paper:

WANG, S.; MINKU, L.L.; YAO, X. "Dealing with Multiple Classes in Online Class Imbalance Learning", 
Proceedings of the 25th International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence (IJCAI'16), July 2016

Please note that this was not the implementation used in the experiments done in the paper above. This implementation was created after that paper was published. However, it implements the algorithm proposed in that paper. So, it should reflect those results.
